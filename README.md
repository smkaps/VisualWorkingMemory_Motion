A key prediction of sensorimotor recruitment models of visual working memory (VWM) is that information is maintained in corresponding perceptual areas of input, thus capable of both influencing and being influenced by incoming sensory information of the same feature group. Prior studies (e.g. Teng & Kravitz, 2019) provide evidence for this bidirectional relationship for orientation and color, demonstrating an interaction between ongoing perception and maintained VWM content consistent with the known tuning curve properties, likely a result of their shared recruitment of perceptual areas.
